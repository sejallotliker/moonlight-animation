            Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. 
            The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, 
            leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided 
            humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with 
            Earth several billion years ago.Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because
             people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting 
             Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna, which is the main adjective for all things
              Moon-related: lunar.<br><br>
              Moon, Earth’s sole natural satellite and nearest large celestial body. Known since prehistoric 
              times, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. It is designated by the symbol ☽. 
              Its name in English, like that of Earth, is of Germanic and Old English derivation.The Moon’s 
              desolate beauty has been a source of fascination and curiosity throughout history and has inspired 
              a rich cultural and symbolic tradition. In past civilizations the Moon was regarded as a deity, 
              its dominion dramatically manifested in its rhythmic control over the tides. <br><br> Ancient lore and legend tell of the power of the Moon to instill spells with magic, to
              transform humans into beasts, and to send people’s behaviour swaying perilously between sanity and 
              lunacy (from the Latin luna, “Moon”). Poets and composers were invoking the Moon’s romantic charms 
              and its darker side, and writers of fiction were conducting their readers on speculative lunar
               journeys long before Apollo astronauts, in orbit above the Moon, sent back photographs of the 
               reality that human eyes were witnessing for the first time. Centuries of observation and scientific
                investigation have been centred on the nature and origin of the Moon. Early studies of the Moon’s 
                motion and position allowed the prediction of tides and led to the development of calendars. <br><br>
